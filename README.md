# Image-Maze-Solver

## How To Use

This program reads in pixel values from an image to determine the fastest possible route through a maze.
Black pixels represent walls and white pixels represent moveable spaces.

An acceptable image must be surrounded with black pixels except for 1 white pixel on the top row (indicating the starting position) and 1 white pixel on the bottom row (indicating the finishing position).

### Example of Acceptable Maze
