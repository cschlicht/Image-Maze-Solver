# Image-Maze-Solver

## How To Use

This program reads in pixel values from an image to determine the fastest possible route through a maze.
Black pixels represent walls and white pixels represent moveable spaces.

An acceptable image must be surrounded with black pixels except for 1 white pixel on the top row (indicating the starting position) and 1 white pixel on the bottom row (indicating the finishing position).

### Example of Acceptable Maze

![](/10x10Maze_Image.PNG)

This image with then be run through an algorithm to determine the shortest possible route.

It can also be run on mazes of larges sizes.

# Testing The Program for Yourself

If you would like to run this on larger Mazes, I found a really helpful websites that creates these images at a large scale.

On this website, change wall thickness to 1, Maze entries to top and bottom, and rows and columns to your specified maze size.
